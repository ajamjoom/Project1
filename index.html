		<h2> Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>I am taking this course because I am really interested in computer science and I want to know how to create interactive websites such as google docs and facebook. In addition to all my interest, I have an idea of a social media website and I really want to try doing it on my own or with a team because I want to get that feeling of creating something.  </p>

		<h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
		<p> The first time I used HTML/CSS was a week ago. Although I am really interested in program and I have took several programing courses but I have never focused on HTML or CSS. So what I did this previous week was that I went over two HTML/CSS books and I think that now I am pretty conforrtable with both of them.I launched a couple of websites and validates some until I felt that I am ready for this course, and I think that I am.</p>

		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>I have took CS106A in Stanford last summer, it's and introduction to java course. After that I went back to school with a really strong desire to spark a coding culture in the middle east so what I did is that I founded a club called weCode; in my school. The club is intedned to ake our coding skills to the next level and to teach more people how to code, so we held weekly meeting and we worked on several project ranging from games to apps for the school.</p>

		<h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
		<p>Never even heard of it before I inrolled in this course</p>

		<h2>Describe your level of experience with programming.</h2>
		<p>I would say that I am pretty comfortable with Java, HTML and CSS and I have the desire ti spend a lot of time enhansing my skills so I dont think tahts a problem for me.</p>

		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>I am working on a Mac</p>

		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
		<p>I am currently self teaching myself how to use XCode because my friend and I have an idea of developing an app together so we are planning to start working on the code after I finish this course so I could have a better understanding of how to create interactive websites and all that </p>
