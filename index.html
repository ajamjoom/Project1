		<h2 id="2ndQ"> Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		
		<p>
			I am taking this course because I am really interested in computer science and I want to know how to create interactive websites such as Google docs and facebook. 
		 </p>

		<h2 id="3rdQ">What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
		
		<p>
			The first time I used HTML/CSS was a week ago. Although I am really interested in programming and I have took several programming courses but I have never focused on HTML or CSS. So what I did this previous week was that I went over two HTML/CSS books and I think that now I am pretty comfortable with both of them. I kept coding, launching and validating websites until I started to not fear them and feel comfortable with them so I think I have a solid foundation now because everything is just fresh in my mind.
		</p>

		<h2 id="4thQ">What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		
		<p>
			I have took CS106A, an introduction to Java course in Stanford, last summer and after that I went back to school with a really strong desire to spark a coding culture in it. So what I did was that I founded a club called weCode; in my school. weCode; is intended to take our coding skills to the next level and to teach more people how to code, so we held weekly meetings and we worked on several projects ranging from games to apps for the school. In addition to enhancing our skills, we wanted to review the basics so what we did is that we hosted help sessions for all beginner classes in my school with the approval of the department of computer science.

		<h2 id="5thQ">Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
		
		<p>
			Never even heard of it before I enrolled in this course
		</p>

		<h2 id="6thQ">Describe your level of experience with programming.</h2>
		
		<p>
			I would say that I am pretty comfortable with all the basics of Java, HTML and CSS. I have the desire to spend a lot of time enhancing my skills so I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem for me.
		</p>

		<h2 id="7thQ">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		
		<p>
			I am working on a Mac
		</p>

		<h2 id="8thQ">Anything else we should know?</h2>
		
		<p>
			I am currently self-teaching myself how to use XCode because my friend and I have an idea of developing an app together and we are planning to start working on the code after I finish this course.
